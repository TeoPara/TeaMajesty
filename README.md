# TeaMajesty
This a tile-based puzzle game.

You have to navigate your way around a maze filled with obstacles, grabbing ingredients for a delicious cup of tea along the way. The tea isn't for you, though. You have to deliver it to the Queen, which is your end goal.

Howwwwever! As you pass through an obstacle, it falls over, and then you shall not pass again. So you've got to strategically envision which path you'll take so as not to get stuck, or miss out on a crucial ingredient! The ingredients/steps towards the completion of your tea are as follows:
- Get the empty cup
- Get the boiling water
- Get the tea
- And finally.. get some milk. Because who doesn't put milk into their tea

__Controls__  
The controls are very simple, you just use WASD or arrow keys to move around, and you press E to pick-up an ingredient from a nearby table.

__Tile-based movement__  
Once you press a movement key, you'll continue walking in that direction until you reach the middle of the next tile, you cannot stop moving mid-tile, or stand between two tiles.
